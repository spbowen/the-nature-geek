            <h4>
                American Flamingo
            </h4>
            <p>
                American flamingos are one of the largest species of flamingo. Found in the Caribbean and along the northern coast of South America, and of course in Florida! these extraordinarily social birds live in flocks that sometimes number in the thousands. A pigment in their food gives their feathers their flamboyant pink color.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Florida Panther
            </h4>
            <p>
                "The Florida panther is a large, long-tailed cat with a great deal of color variation: pale brown or rusty upper parts, dull white or buffy under parts; tail tip, back of ears, and sides of nose are dark brown or blackish. Mature male panthers examined in the wild in Florida since 1978 have weighed from 102 to 154 pounds (Roelke 1990, Roelke and Glass 1992) and measured nearly 7 feet from nose to tip of tail. Females were considerably smaller, with a weight range of 50 to 108 pounds (Roelke 1990) and measuring about 6 feet (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1987)." - U.S Fish and Wildlife
            </p>
            <h4> 
                Manatee
            </h4>
            <p>
                "Manatees live in marine, brackish and freshwater systems in coastal and riverine areas throughout their range. Preferred habitats include areas near the shore featuring underwater vegetation like seagrass and eelgrass. They feed along grass bed margins with access to deep water channels, where they flee when threatened. Florida manatees can be found throughout Florida for most of the year. However, they cannot tolerate temperatures below 68 degrees Fahrenheit for extended periods of time, and during the winter months these cold temperatures keep the population concentrated in peninsular Florida. Many manatees rely on the warm water from natural springs and power plant outfalls.
                During the summer manatees expand their range, and on rare occasions are seen as far north as Massachusetts on the Atlantic coast and as far west as Texas on the Gulf coast. Manatees may travel hundreds of miles during a year’s time, preferring to travel along channels and shorelines." - US Fish and Wildlife
            </p>
            <h4> American Alligator </h4>
            <p>
                "American alligators are large crocodilians found only in the United States. They can grow to be more than 12 feet (3.6 meters) in length and weigh as much as 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms), with males being slightly larger than females on average. The animal’s dark skin is armored with small, bony scales called scutes. A long, powerful tail helps propel the animal through water, as do webbed feet. They are cold-blooded and depend on the natural world around them to provide warmth. To do this, they will bask in the sun or dig holes in mud to trap heat. Although American alligators can be hard to miss while basking on the shore, they can look eerily like logs when floating in the water.
                A cousin of the alligator, the American crocodile, is very rare in the U.S. and only a few thousand individuals live on the southern tip of Florida. The best way to tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile is by looking at the mouth. Alligators have a wide, round snout, while crocodiles have a long, thin snout. Crocodiles also have two large teeth that stick out when their mouth is closed." - National Wildlife Federation

Many of the nonnative plants that were grown at the nursery, such as Madagascar periwinkle and asparagus fern have escaped into the hammock. An intensive nonnative invasive plant removal project is underway.
